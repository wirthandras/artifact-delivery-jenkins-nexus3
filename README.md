# artifact-delivery-jenkins-nexus3

This project is a small piece of my self training progress

# Goal

Aim to deliver docker images to a locally hosted nexus3 docker repository with jenkins pipeline

The project contains a Dockerfile which help me to build a dockerized jenkins which can run maven and dotnet based jenkins declarative pipelines.
